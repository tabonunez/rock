Strategy summary:

- For each coin, calculate a 360-period moving average (MA) on hourly close prices.
- Generate a long entry signal when the MA increases by more than 1 basis point from the previous period (ma_change > 1).
- Enter at the previous close when the signal switches from 0 to 1; exit at the current close when it switches from 1 to 0.
- Compute PnL for each trade, and track cumulative PnL.
- Combine results for a portfolio of coins using specified weights.
- Calculate and record drawdown statistics for each asset and the portfolio.

This is a simple trend-following strategy based on MA momentum, tested on multiple crypto assets and aggregated into a weighted portfolio.
